# Synergy
A quick and easy way for Geek Squad Agents to generate a text file with a client's new serial numbers.

When you're in the Precinct, every second counts, especially when your benches get full. So, Synergy takes something that normally takes a minute, and shrinks it down to seconds. Thanks to the new key generation portal, paired with Synergy, all you have to do is copy the serial numbers for Bitdefender and Acronis, along with a client's GCID into the app, hit generate, and it will sort out the rest.

To set the default path for saving generated files to, right-click on the 'Open Folder Location' button, and click the 'Edit' option.

Also, because we're dealing with serial numbers and GCID's that are both unique and valuable to a client, I have made this app open-source so you can easily see the source coding, and know that nothing is saved within the app (besides the folder location). This means that nothing is saved, shared, or sent anywhere, to anyone or anything.
