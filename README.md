# Synergy
A quick and easy way for Geek Squad Agents to generate a text file with a client's new serial numbers.

<i>Please note that this app is designed for Geek Squad Agents in the Precinct only, and has zero-value or use to anyone else.</I>

When you're in the Precinct, every second counts, especially when your benches get full. So, Synergy takes something that normally takes a minute, and shrinks it down to seconds. Thanks to the new key generation portal, paired with Synergy, all you have to do is copy the serial numbers for Bitdefender and Acronis, along with a client's GCID into the app, hit generate, and it will sort out the rest.

To set the default path for saving generated files to, right-click on the 'Open Folder Location' button, and click the 'Edit' option.

Also, because we're dealing with serial numbers and GCID's that are both unique and valuable to a client, I have made this app open-source so you can easily see the source coding. The only information that is stored within the app is the save folder location, and the most recent three GCID's, which can be reset and cleared in the Settings panel. An option to disable this feature is coming in a future update. No information besides those are stored, and no information at all is sent or shared with anyone or anything.
